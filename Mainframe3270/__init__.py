class Mainframe3270(DynamicCore):
    r"""
    Mainframe3270 is a library for Robot Framework based on the [https://pypi.org/project/py3270/|py3270 project],
    a Python interface to x3270, an IBM 3270 terminal emulator. It provides an API to a x3270 or s3270 subprocess.

    = Installation  =

    To use this library, you must have the [http://x3270.bgp.nu/download.html|x3270 project] installed and included in your PATH.
    On Windows, you can install wc3270 and add "C:\Program Files\wc3270" to your PATH in the Environment Variables.

    = Example =

    | *** Settings ***
    | Library           Mainframe3270
    |
    | *** Test Cases ***
    | Example
    |     Open Connection    Hostname    LUname
    |     Change Wait Time    0.4 seconds
    |     Change Wait Time After Write    0.4 seconds
    |     Set Screenshot Folder    C:\\Temp\\IMG
    |     ${value}    Read    3    10    17
    |     Page Should Contain String    ENTER APPLICATION
    |     Wait Field Detected
    |     Write Bare    applicationname
    |     Send Enter
    |     Take Screenshot
    |     Close Connection

    = Concurrent Connections =

    The library allows you to have multiple sessions open at the same time. Each session opened by `Open Connection` or
    `Open Connection From Session File` will return an index that can be used to reference it
    when switching between connections using the `Switch Connection` keyword. The indices start from 1 and are incremented
    by each newly opened connection. Calling `Close All Connection` will reset the index counter to 1.

    Additionally, you can provide aliases to your sessions when opening a connection, and switch the connection
    using that alias instead of the index.

    It is worth noting that the connection that was opened last is always the current connection.

    | *** Test Cases ***
    | Concurrent Sessions
    |     ${index_1}    Open Connection    Hostname    # this is the current connection
    |     Write Bare    First String
    |     ${index_2}    Open Connection    Hostname    alias=second    # 'second' is now the current connection
    |     Write Bare    Second String
    |     Switch Connection    ${index_1}    # swtiching the connection using the index
    |     Page Should Contain String    First String
    |     Switch Connection    second    # switchting the ocnnection using the alias
    |     Page Should Contain String    Second String
    |     [Teardown]    Close All Connections

    = Changing the emulator model (experimental) =

    By default, the library uses the emulator model 2, which is 24 rows by 80 columns.
    You can, however, change the model globally when `importing` the library with the `model` argument
    set to the model of your choice.

    The basic models are 2, 3, 4, and 5. These models differ in their screen size as illustrated in this table:

    | *3270 Model* | *Rows* | *Columns* |
    | 2            | 24     | 80        |
    | 3            | 32     | 80        |
    | 4            | 43     | 80        |
    | 5            | 27     | 132       |


    They can be combined with the 3278 (monochrome green-screen) or 3279 (color) prefix, e.g. 3278-2 or 3279-2.

    In addition to that, there is a -E suffix that indicates support for the [https://x3270.miraheze.org/wiki/3270_data_stream_protocol#extended|x3270 extended data stream].

    You can find more information on emulator models on the [https://x3270.miraheze.org/wiki/3270_models|x3270 wiki].

    In addition to setting the model globally, you can also set the model on the individual emulator basis by providing the model arguments to the `Open Connection`
    or `Open Connection From Session File` keywords.

    Here is an example for setting the emulator in the Open Connection keyword:

    | Open Connection    pub400.com    extra_args=["-xrm", "*model: 4"]

    And this is how you would set the emulator model in the Open Connection From Session File keyword:

    | Open Connection From Session File    /path/to/session/file

    Where the content of the session file would be

    | *hostname: pub400.com
    | *model: 4


    Note that this is an experimental feature, so not all models might work as expected.

        By default, the emulator visibility is set to visible=True.
        In this case test cases are executed using wc3270 (Windows) or x3270 (Linux/MacOSX).
        You can change this by setting visible=False.
        Then test cases are run using ws3720 (Windows) or s3270 (Linux/MacOS).
        This is useful when test cases are run in a CI/CD-pipeline and there is no need for a graphical user interface.

        Timeout, waits and screenshot folder are set on library import as shown above.
        However, they can be changed during runtime. To modify the ``wait_time``, see `Change Wait Time`,
        to modify the ``img_folder``, see `Set Screenshot Folder`,
        and to modify the ``timeout``, see the `Change Timeout` keyword. Timeouts support all available
        Robot Framework [https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#time-format|time formats].

        By default, Mainframe3270 will take a screenshot on failure.
        You can overwrite this to run any other keyword by setting the ``run_on_failure_keyword`` option.
        If you pass ``None`` to this argument, no keyword will be run.
        To change the ``run_on_failure_keyword`` during runtime, see `Register Run On Failure Keyword`.
